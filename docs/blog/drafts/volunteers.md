title: Can I get some volunteers please?
---

I had an idea.
Sometimes I have some free time left and energy to program a bit.
The issue is that I'm not all that creative when it comes to finding ideas to actualky program.
So I usually end up browsing the world wide web in search if inspiration.
Browsing Github and the likes.
But a little while back I did have an idea!
What if I could find someone that comea up with ideas for me?
The idea is simple really.
Other people might have the thougths but don't have the means.

## But who will you help?

That should be simple too.
Their are enough organisations (like non-profit) that have plenty of smart creative people but lack a developer.
It could even do it voluntarely, right?
But wait there are organisations that provide a database of jobs for people that want to help out.
An example [from Flanders](https://vrijwilligerswerk.be/) contains quite a few jobs.
But, unfortunately, there aren't any developer jobs.
Maybe the odd site admin job but nothing really to develop a program.


## The program is under maintenance

Let's recap: we got the ideas and we can actually create the programs.
That should be everything?
Oh right we still need to maintain the program...
But is that something that I want to do?



notes: make it less like I'm doing the world a favor by doing this.
